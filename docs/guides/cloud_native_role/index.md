# Custom Cloud Native role

Cloud Native solutions can be deployed on the Nutanix Cloud Platform by a user with administrative permissions. In various scenarios, this is not desired and a least privileged user should be used to deploy solutions.

This page will illustrate the steps required to create a custom Cloud Native role in Prism Central that can be assigned to Prism Central users. The custom role will be created using `Ansible` and the [Nutanix Ansible Collection](https://github.com/nutanix/nutanix.ansible){target=_blank}. 

## Prerequisites
- [Install Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html){target=_blank}
- Install the Nutanix `nutanix.ncp` [collection](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections_guide/collections_installing.html#installing-collections-with-ansible-galaxy){target=_blank}

## Steps

- (Optional) Export environment variables to authenticate to Prism Central.
  ```bash
  export NUTANIX_HOST=<Prism Central FQDN/IP>
  export NUTANIX_USERNAME=<Prism Central Username>
  export NUTANIX_PASSWORD=<Prism Central Password>
  ```
  Ensure the user has the required permissions to create a role in Prism Central. 
!!! note
    These variables can also be specified directly in the Ansible Playbook. See the Nutanix Ansible documentation for more details.

- Create a new Ansible playbook YAML file (for example `role.yaml`) that uses the `ntnx_roles` module. See the [example](#example)
- Invoked the playbook: `ansible-playbook role.yaml`
- When the role is created, go to Prism Central and assign users. 


## Example

!!! note 
    Update the `role_name` variable if a different name for the custom role is desired.

```YAML
---
- hosts: localhost
  collections:
    - nutanix.ncp
  vars:
    role_name: "Cloud Native Role"
  tasks:
    - name: Create Cloud Native role
      ntnx_roles:
        state: present
        name: "{{ role_name }}"
        permissions:
          - name: "Create_Category_Mapping"
          - name: "Create_Image"
          - name: "Create_Or_Update_Name_Category"
          - name: "Create_Or_Update_Value_Category"
          - name: "Create_Virtual_Machine"
          - name: "Delete_Category_Mapping"
          - name: "Delete_Image"
          - name: "Delete_Name_Category"
          - name: "Delete_Value_Category"
          - name: "Delete_Virtual_Machine"
          - name: "View_Category_Mapping"
          - name: "View_Cluster"
          - name: "View_Image"
          - name: "View_Name_Category"
          - name: "View_Project"
          - name: "View_Subnet"
          - name: "View_Value_Category"
          - name: "View_Virtual_Machine"
        wait: true
```
!!! note 
    Verify the documentation of the cloud native solution on the required list of permissions.
