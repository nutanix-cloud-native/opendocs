# Proxy configuration

!!! warning
        The scenario and features described on this page are experimental. It's important to note that they have not been fully validated.

CAPX can be configured to use a proxy to connect to external networks. This proxy configuration needs to be applied to control plane and worker nodes. 

Follow the steps below to configure a CAPX cluster to use a proxy.

## Steps
1. Generate a `cluster.yaml` file with the required CAPX cluster configuration. Refer to the [Getting Started](../getting_started.md){target=_blank} page for more information on how to generate a `cluster.yaml` file. Do not apply the `cluster.yaml` file. 
2. Edit the `cluster.yaml` file and modify the following resources as shown in the [example](#example) below to add the proxy configuration.
    1. `KubeadmControlPlane`: 
        * Add the proxy configuration to the `spec.kubeadmConfigSpec.files` list. Do not modify other items in the list.
        * Add `systemctl` commands to apply the proxy config in `spec.kubeadmConfigSpec.preKubeadmCommands`. Do not modify other items in the list.
    2. `KubeadmConfigTemplate`: 
        * Add the proxy configuration to the `spec.template.spec.files` list. Do not modify other items in the list.
        * Add `systemctl` commands to apply the proxy config in `spec.template.spec.preKubeadmCommands`. Do not modify other items in the list.
4. Apply the `cluster.yaml` file
